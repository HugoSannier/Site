                DISCO GECKO is a 2v2 party game where you&apos;re lost in a huge jungle nightclub and must find your friend! Use your tongue and the environment to get in the way of the opposing team... and be the first two geckos to kiss!
                <br> <br>
                I was the sole sound designer working on Disco Gecko. I established the audio artistic direction in collaboration with the game artist and designer. I also managed communication with our two external composers. I used Wwise for integration, and in Unity, I worked with a dedicated tool developed by the programmers on the project. <br><br>


                The main challenge in the project was the mixing. We wanted to have a lot of elements, loud music, a nice jungle ambiances, and audio feedbacks that indicate the location of the landmarks.. On top of this, the game supports up designed for 4 players, which means there are four audio listeners. To manage all these elements, I designed an audio system in Wwise that adjusts the volume of the ambient sounds and music busses when feedback sounds are triggered. 
                <br><br>


                Additionally, I implemented a listener panning system. This system routes sounds heard by players on the left side of the screen to the left speakers, while sounds on the right side are sent to the right speakers, creating a more immersive experience for players.
